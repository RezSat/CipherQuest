# CipherQuest
One of my beginner projects, Game to determine the plain text of the given cipher text. This uses only Caesar Cipher.
Just found this inside my old folders and was written in python2 so I just updated it with certain things suited for new versions of python.

** Of course it needs pygame to run **

Also you have words like : 'Brasília', 'Yaoundé', "eric a. cornell" 

I'm not going to fix those its booring, and since this was done in my early stages of learning python, I like to keep them so that I know how stupid I was.
